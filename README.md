## Introduction

Dive deep into the fascinating world of Crew AI and learn how to build your autonomous agents from scratch. This project is a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Crew AI's capabilities to design intelligent systems that can perform tasks autonomously, think for themselves, and work together as a crew.

## How It Works

The tutorial covers the following key concepts and steps:

1. **Crew AI Overview:** Introduction to Crew AI and its core components.

2. **Building the Crew:** Step-by-step instructions on creating your crew, including defining tasks, agents, and the tools they'll use.

3. **Designing Autonomous Agents:** Guidelines for designing agents with specific roles, goals, and the ability to think and act independently.

4. **Implementing Tasks and Tools:** How to create tasks that your crew will perform and the tools agents can use to accomplish these tasks.

5. **Running the Crew:** Instructions on how to kick off your crew, allowing the autonomous agents to execute the defined tasks and achieve the project's goal.

## Dependencies and Installation

To get started with the Crew AI tutorial project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Initialize your virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies by executing:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your API keys for Crew AI and any other services used in the project. Add them to the `.env` file in the project's root directory.

## Example Input

What are the emails for the participants (other than you) in the meeting?
ninja@gmail.com, yotaml@elad.co.il, linyotam@gmail.com

What is the context of the meeting?
The participants of the meeting have decided that they want to find a new industry to invest in. They have lost faith in artificial intelligence, so they want to start investing in cat coffee shops. cat coffee shops are cafes where people come to drink soft drinks with cats walking around. the clients are allowed to pet the cats.

What is your objective for this meeting?
Find a way to enter this new market and make it profitable. ideally, the participants should be able to find a location to open their first cat coffee shop.
